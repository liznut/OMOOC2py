to make a widget in Tk, the command is always of the form:

classCommand newPathname options

classCommand
	denotes which kind of widget to make (a button, a label, a menu...)

newPathname
	is the new name for this widget. All names in Tk must be unique. To help enforce this, widgets in Tk are named with pathnames, just like files in a file system.
